1.3 New mechanics
- Now tranquilizer guns not just put 'Anesthetic' effect on target - they add new stacking 'Tranquilized' hediff. Effectiveness of tranquilizer effect depends of target body size. As example, rabbits going down from one shot, human takes 3-4 shots.
- Rifle and pistol got increased accuracy due to new tranquilizer mechanics.
- New sprites!

1.2 Balanced weapons
I guess guns became too weak:
- Rifle and pistol range changed from 15/10 to 18/12.
- Tranquilizer bullet speed increased from 40 to 50. It's a little slower than bolt rifle bullet.

- Now Rifle has weight of 2 kg, Pistol - 1kg.
- Rifle/Pistol range is 15/10.
- Rifle/Pistol warmup time is 2/1.1
- Both gun now have reduced accuracy
